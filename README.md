# isabelle_graph

This is a project written in Isabelle/HOL, a interactive proof assistant.
Some graph properties and algorithms are written, and some properties are proved using Isabelle/HOL.

There are some lemmas that I failed to prove, are marked with `sorry`.
Some algorithms still has bug inside, due to time limitation, I could not resolve it right now.

>Note: this is only a small project I wrote during my bachelor's study. No full correctness guaranteed.
